#  Unified Diagram of four kinds of Artificial Intelligence agents

## Introduction

This is my attempt to unify the four first kinds of AI agents as described in the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", authored by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell; an AI classic used by more 1500 educational institutions around the world.

Originally, each of the four agents are described in its own schematic, although I was not satisfied because there were several components in common to all of them. This unified view may help to understand it.

To read it - see what components a kind of AI agent makes use of- follow the conditional symbol (or gate) with the corresponding letter of the agent. For instance, the simplest of all agents is the "(R)eflex agent". Start at "Sensors" at the top, go down by "What the world is like now", go through the gate "R", descend on "What action should do now", and arrive to "Actuators" at the bottom. That all it takes to a "Reflex agent". Pay attention to the blueish surroundings which is the "Environment". An example could be the earliest generation of the autonomous vacuum cleaner.

The 2nd kind is the "Model-based Reflex" agent. Although it makes use of C-A rules, it keeps track of the state of the Environment, and the changes after performing an action.
